    <h3 style="font-family: Georgia, serif">Description</h3>


    <p style="border-width:3px; border-style:dotted; border-color:#FF0000">Purchase split wings (little drumsticks and the flat parts) to save time from splitting whole chicken wings yourself. These can be made with fresh or frozen wings. Frozen wings will need more time to cook. These are seasoned with lemon pepper seasoning. If using store-bought, taste it before adding (we prefer homemade lemon pepper seasoning). Some brands can be incredibly salty so you might need to reduce the amount you add to the wings. Once cooked these are tossed with lemon butter and then generously sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper. SO good! If you have a pepper grinder, now is the time to use it!</p>
